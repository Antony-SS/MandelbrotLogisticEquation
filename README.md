Saw a video about the Mandelbrot set which piqued my curiousity.  This jupyter notebook explores the logistic equation behind the mandelbrot set.  

I use populations in the notebook as an example of a real world application of a logistic equation.  Makes it easier to wrap your head around.

Really cool phenomenom.  I would love to explore more when I have the time.
