Saw a video about the Mandelbrot set and was curious as to why this set is a thing.  Did some research and figured out that it arises from a logistic equation.  

This jupyter notebook explores that a little.  

I use populations in the notebook as an example of a real world application of a logistic equation.  Makes it easier to wrap your head around.

Really cool phenomenom.  I would love to explore more when I have the time.
